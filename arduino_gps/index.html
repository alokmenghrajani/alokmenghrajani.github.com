      <p>
        Everybody knows that Arduinos are a great way to play around with microcontrollers.
        In this article, I'm going to show how easy it was to interface a GPS receiver with
        a LCD display.

    <p>
      I purchased an Ultimate Arduino Microcontroller Pack
      (you can order the pack online at
      <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/shed/ultimate-microcontroller-pack/">Makershed</a> or buy it
      at your local <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12353398">RadioShack</a>).
      The pack comes with an Arduino UNO and ton of components. It would probably be cheaper to
      buy components as I need them for my projects, but I like the convenience
      of a starter kit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also purchased a
      <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?WT.z_header=search_go&lang=en&site=us&keywords=28501PAR-ND&x=-1373&y=-51">GPS module</a>
      from Digikey.com and a USB cable (it's too bad that
      the pack does not include the USB cable). The GPS receiver has a built-in
      antenna, but getting one with an external antenna would probably work best.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the pack, I ended using the Arduino UNO, the mini breadboard, a few stackable
      headers, jumper wires and the LCD screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The total hardware cost is around $175 (if you skip the pack and purchase the individual components,
      you can probably get everything for ~$100):
      <ul>
        <li>Ultimate Arduino Microcontroller Pack ($130)</li>
        <li>A USB cable (5$)</li>
        <li>GPS receiver ($40)</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="page-header"><h3>making sure the Arduino works</h3></div>
    <p>
      The first step is to make sure the Arduino works. The exact
      installation process is beyond the scope of this article. I connected the Arduino to
      my laptop, installed the software and selected one of the samples (<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/blink">Blink</a>).
      After uploading the code to the Arduino, I had a led that was blinking every second:

    <div class="page-header"><h3>connecting the LCD</h3></div>
    <p>
      The LCD screen is a Topway (P050001501) LMB162ABC. It can display 16 characters on two rows (16x2)
      and is compatible with the Hitachi HD44780, so I simply connected the display as
      explained on the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/LiquidCrystal">Liquid Crystal tutorial</a>.
      I did not want to add a potentiometer to control the contrast, so I grounded Vo.
    </p>
    <p>I uploaded the sample code to the Arduino and made sure the LCD worked and displayed "hello, world!".</p>

    <div class="page-header"><h3>connecting the GPS</h3></div>
    <p>
      The GPS receiver is a Parallax PMB-688. I got a little confused, because the specification
      and the PCB disagree on the pin labeling. By looking at the cable colors, and a little bit
      of trial and error, I was able to figure out that the spec is right (the PCB was misprinted?).
    </p>
    <p>
      The GPS module transmits the information in serial TTL format. This makes it trivial to
      interface with the Arduino: all we need to do is connect the GPS's TTL TX to the Arduino's
      pin 0 (RX) and we are done. We don't need to write any code or built a circuit with resistors
      and capacitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's important to note that the Arduino's pins 0 and 1 (RX and TX) are also used to connect
      to your computer with USB. This means you need to disconnect the GPS when uploading code
      to the Arduino. It's pretty annoying. You can get around this by using an Arduino which has
      more serial ports (e.g. <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardMega2560">Arduino Mega</a>
      or <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDue">Arduino Due</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The GPS receiver contains a built-in battery. This means when we power it up, we'll sometimes
      get the time right away, other times we'll have to wait for a few seconds, until the receiver
      locates a satellite and computes the time/position information. The location position always
      takes a few seconds to appea. I wasn't able to get any information
      about the type of built-in, if it's capacitor based it can last for a few hours or days. If it's
      a rechargeable battery, it can keep the time for a few years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GPS receiver has an onboard LED. When the LED is on, it indicates a valid signal. If it's flashing,
      it indicates the device is powered on but hasn't yet acquired a signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using a GPS with a built-in antenna, you should make
      sure to be in a place where you can see plenty of sky (e.g. the
      middle of a field works great).
    </p>

    <div class="page-header"><h3>generating a Google maps url</h3></div>
    <p>
      The GPS data is in hours/minutes/seconds format. The Google maps for a given position can be
      render by going to <code>https://maps.google.com/?ll=&lt;LAT&gt;,&ltLONG&gt;</code>, where the latitude and
      longitude are in decimal format. The output from the GPS can be converted to decimal format by taking the
      last 6 digits and dividing by 60. South and West coordinates need to be multiplied by -1.
    </p>
    <p>
      For e.g. "3746.2779,N,12223.3198,W" becomes 37+(46.2779/60),-1*(122+(23.3198/60))=37.7713,-122.3887:

    <p>
      Matt and I connected the GPS module to a <a href="http://www.saleae.com/logic">Salae</a> logic analyzer. The device rendered a nice
      output of the GPS signal and also automatically decoded the TTL protocol.
      The decide is pretty cheap ($149) and can save lots of time when debugging hardware projects.

    <div class="page-header"><h3>the code</h3></div>
    <p>
      The GPS transmits information in a format called NMEA. We are interested in strings which begin with "$GPRMC".
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://playground.arduino.cc/Tutorials/GPS">GPS tutorial</a> was also useful. I however rewrote the
      code, because <code>linea[conta]</code> can potentially overflow,
      as well as <code>indices[cont]</code>. The author also did not explain the origin of <code>int i=1</code>
      in <code>for (int i=1;i<7;i++){</code> (it turns out, the 1 is due to the code detecting <code>byteGPS==13</code>
      as the transmission ending condition, instead of <code>byteGPS==10</code>).
    </p>

      Here is a sample output from the receiver:
