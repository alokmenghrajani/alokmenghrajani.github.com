= SDL

Interface of this lib is very close to SDL.
So you also had better refer to SDL document.

nAll classes/modules in Ruby/SDL are in "module SDL".
In this module number starts 0,not 1.

== Error handling
=== SDL::Error

SDL::Error is exception class. Almost all of errors in Ruby/SDL are
reported by this class.

==== super class

StandardError

== initialize

=== module functions in module SDL

--- SDL.init(flag)
      Initialize SDL. This should be called before all other SDL functions. The
      flags parameter specifies what part(s) of SDL to initialize.
        SDL::INIT_AUDIO  initialize audio output functions
        SDL::INIT_VIDEO  initialize video output functions and input functions
        SDL::INIT_CDROM  initialize CD playback fucntions
        SDL::INIT_JOYSTICK  initialize joystick input functions
      You should call this method before calling other Ruby/SDL methods.

--- SDL.quit
      Quit SDL system. You needn't call this function normally because
      this library call this function automatically when the process 
      stops.

      
--- SDL.initedSystem(flag)
--- SDL.inited_system(flag)
      Not documented yet

--- SDL.getenv
--- SDL.putenv(envstr)
      Change or add an environment variable on Win32. On other platforms
      this method is equal to ENV.
      
      ((|envstr|)) should be of the form "name=value".

      Returns nil, raise exception `SDL::Error' when it fails.

      You should use this method to set SDL_WINDOWID or SDL_VIDEODRIVER.
== video

some functions need SGE or SDL_image

=== functions in module SDL

--- SDL.getVideoSurface
--- SDL.get_video_surface
      Not documented yet

--- SDL.setVideoMode(w,h,bpp,flags)
--- SDL.set_video_mode(w,h,bpp,flags)
      Set up a video mode with the specified width, height and bits-per-pixel.
      If bpp is 0, it is treated as the current display bits per pixel.
      Return the instanse of ((<SDL::Screen>)), if succeeded.
      Raise SDL::Error, if failed.
      * SDL::SWSURFACE
        
        Create the video surface in system memory.

      * SDL::HWSURFACE

        Create the video surface in video memory.

      * SDL::FULLSCREEN

        SDL will attempt to use a fullscreen mode.

      * SDL::SDL_DOUBLEBUF

        Enable double buffering.
        Calling ((<SDL::Screen#flip>)) will flip the  buffers and update
        the screen.

--- SDL.checkVideoMode(w,h,bpp,flags)
--- SDL.check_video_mode(w,h,bpp,flags)
      Check to see if a particular video mode is supported.
      Returns 0 if the requested mode is not supported under any
      bit depth, or returns the bits-per-pixel of the closest available mode
      with the given width, height and requested surface flags (see 
      SDL_SetVideoMode).

      The bits-per-pixel value returned is only a suggested mode. You can
      usually request and bpp you want when setting the video mode and SDL will
      emulate that color depth with a shadow video surface.
      
      The arguments to checkVideoMode are the same ones you would pass to
      ((<SDL.setVideoMode>)).

--- SDL.listModes(flags)
--- SDL.list_modes(flags)
      Returns availanel screen demensions for the given flags.
      Returns nil if there are no available dimensions.
      Returns true if any dimension is okay.
      Otherwise returns list of available dimensions in array.

--- SDL.videoDriverName
--- SDL.video_driver_name
      Returns the name of initialized video driver like "x11" or "windib".
      Raise exeption if video have not been initialized.

--- SDL.setGamma(redgamma,greengamma,bluegamma)
--- SDL.set_gamma(redgamma,greengamma,bluegamma)
      Sets the "gamma function" for the display of each color component.
      Gamma controls the brightness/contrast of colors displayed on
      the screen. A gamma value of 1.0 is identity
      (i.e., no adjustment is made).

--- SDL.getGammaRamp
--- SDL.get_gamma_ramp
      Returns the gamma translation lookup tables currently used
      by the display. Return value is array that has r, g, b table.
      Each table is array that has 256 integer.

--- SDL.setGammaRamp(table)
--- SDL.set_gamma_ramp(table)
      Sets the gamma lookup tables for the display for each color component.
      table should be an array like what you can get
      with ((<SDL.getGammaRamp>)).

--- SDL.autoLock
--- SDL.auto_lock
--- SDL.autoLock?
--- SDL.auto_lock?
      Needs SGE

      Returns whether Ruby/SDL locks surface automatically when
      need.Default is true.

--- SDL.blitSurface(src,srcX,srcY,srcW,srcH,dst,dstX,dstY)
--- SDL.blit_surface(src,srcX,srcY,srcW,srcH,dst,dstX,dstY)
      This performs a fast blit from the source surface to the destination
      surface.

      If srcX=srcY=srcW=srcH=0,the entire surface is copied.

      The blit function should not be called on a locked surface.

--- SDL.blitSurface2(src,srcRect,dst,dstRect)
--- SDL.blit_surface2(src,src_rect,dst,dst_rect)
      You use this function like:
        blitSurface2(src,[0,32,32,32],dst,[100,200])
      or
        Rect = Struct.new( 'Rect', :x, :y, :w, :h )
        
        rect1 = Rect.new( 16, 0, 16, 16 )
        rect2 = Rect.new( 120, 0, 0, 0 )
        blitSurface2( src, rect1, dst, rect2 )
      
--- SDL.rotateXYScaled(src,dst,x,y,angle,xscale,yscale)
--- SDL.rotateXY_scaled(src,dst,x,y,angle,xscale,yscale)
      Needs SGE

      Note that this function is different from SGE sge_rotate_xyscaled API
      in that src and dst are changing.
      Following two functions are same.
      This is equal to blitSurface.

      And note that this function ignores colorkey.

      This method is obsolete. Please use ((<SDL.transform>)) or
      ((<SDL.transformBlit>))

--- SDL.rotateScaled(src,dst,x,y,angle,scale)
--- SDL.rotate_scaled(src,dst,x,y,angle,scale)
      Same as above, but with xscale=yscale.

--- SDL.rotate(src,dst,x,y,angle)
      Same as above, but with xscale=yscale=1.0.

--- SDL.rotateScaledBlit(src,dst,x,y,angle,scale)
--- SDL.rotate_scaled_blit(src,dst,x,y,angle,scale)
      Needs SGE

      Same as rotateScaled,but respect colorkey.

--- SDL.rotateBlit(src,dst,x,y,angle)
--- SDL.rotate_blit(src,dst,x,y,angle)
      Same as rotateScaledBlit,but with scale=1.0;

--- SDL.transform(src,dst,angle,xscale,yscale,px,py,qx,qy,flags)
      Need SGE

      Draw src surface to dst surface with scaling and rotation.
      Ignore colorkey.

      *src - The surface to be rotated and scaled
      *src - The surface to be rotated and scaled
      *angle - The rotation angle in degrees.
      *xscale  yscale - The x and y scaling factor. Can be negative
       (mirroring). 1.0 is 1:1 scale.
      *px / py - The pivot point to rotate around in the src surface.
      *qx / qy - The destination point on dst surface.
      *flags
        *0 - Default.
        *SGE_TAA - Use the interpolating renderer. Much slower but
         can look better.
        *SGE_TSAFE - Don't asume that the src and dst surfaces has the
         same pixel format. This is the default when the two surfaces
         don't have the same BPP.
         This is slower but will render wierd pixel formats right.
        *SGE_TTMAP - Use texture mapping. This is a bit faster
         but the result isn't
         as nice as in the normal mode. This mode will also ignore the px/py
         coordinates and the other flags.

--- SDL.transformBlit(src,dst,angle,xscale,yscale,px,py,qx,qy,flags)
--- SDL.transform_blit(src,dst,angle,xscale,yscale,px,py,qx,qy,flags)
      Need SGE

      Blit src surface to dst surface with scaling and rotation.
      Same as ((<SDL.transform>)) , but respect colorkey.

Object

==== class method

--- SDL::Surface.new(flag,w,h,format)
--- SDL::Surface.new(flags,w,h,depth,Rmask,Gmask,Bmask,Amask)
      Create an empty surface.
      You must call this method after ((<SDL.setVideoMode>))

      format must be the instance of ((<SDL::Surface>)), and create the
      surface that has same bpp as specified surface.
      
      The flags specifies the type of surface that should be
      created, it is an OR'd combination of the following possible values.
      
      * SDL::SWSURFACE

        SDL will create the surface in system memory.

      * SDL::HWSURFACE

        SDL will attempt to create the surface in video memory.

      * SDL::SRCCOLORKEY

        With this flag SDL will attempt to find the best
        location for this surface, either in system memory or
        video memory, to obtain hardware colorkey blitting
        support.

      * SDL::SRCALPHA

        With this flag SDL will attempt to find the best
        location for this surface, either in system memory or
        video memory, to obtain hardware alpha support.
        
--- SDL::Surface.new_from(pixels,w,h,depth,pitch,Rmask,Gmask,Bmask,Amask)
      Create a surface from pixel data.
      ((|pixels|)) must be String. ((|pitch|)) is the length of
      each scanline in bytes.
      
--- SDL::Surface.loadBMP(filename)
--- SDL::Surface.load_bmp(filename)
      Loads a image from a named Windows BMP file and return
      the instance of ((<SDL::Screen>)).

      Raise SDL::Error if you have an error,for example file didn't exist.
      
--- SDL::Surface.load(filename)
      Needs SDL_image
      Loads a image from a named Windows BMP file and return
      the instance of ((<SDL::Screen>)).

      Available formats are BMP,PPX,XPM,PCX,GIF,JPEG,PNG,TGA.

==== method

--- SDL::Surface#saveBMP(filename)
--- SDL::Surface#save_bmp(filename)
      Saves the surface as a Windows BMP file named file.

--- SDL::Surface#displayFormat
--- SDL::Surface#display_format
      This method copies self to a new surface of the pixel
      format and colors of the video framebuffer, suitable for fast blitting
      onto the display surface.
      
      If you want to take advantage of hardware colorkey or alpha blit
      acceleration, you should set the colorkey and alpha value before calling
      this method.

--- SDL::Surface#displayFormatAlpha
--- SDL::Surface#display_format_alpha
      Same as ((<SDL::Surface#displayFormat>)), except respecting
      alpha value per pixel.

--- SDL::Surface#setColorKey(flag,key)
--- SDL::Surface#set_color_key(flag,key)
      Sets the color key (transparent pixel) in a blittable surface and enables
      or disables RLE blit acceleration.
      If flag is SDL::SRCCOLORKEY then key is the transparent pixel
      value in the source image of a blit.
      If flag is OR'd with SDL::RLEACCEL then the surface will be draw
      using RLE acceleration when drawn with blitting.

--- SDL::Surface#fillRect(x,y,w,h)
--- SDL::Surface#fill_rect(x,y,w,h)
      This function performs a fast fill of the given rectangle with color.

--- SDL::Surface#setClipRect(x,y,w,h)
--- SDL::Surface#set_clip_rect(x,y,w,h)
      Sets the clipping rectangle for a surface. When this surface is the
      destination of a blit, only the area within the clip rectangle will
      be drawn into.
      
      The rectangle pointed to by rect will be clipped to the edges of the
      surface so that the clip rectangle for a surface can never fall
      outside the edges of the surface.

--- SDL::Surface#getClipRect
--- SDL::Surface#get_clip_rect
      Returns the clipping rectangle for this surface.
      Return value is an array including x, y, r, w value.

--- SDL::Surface#setAlpha(flag,alpha)
--- SDL::Surface#set_alpha(flag,alpha)
      SDL_SetAlpha is used for setting the per-surface alpha and/or enabling
      and disabling per-pixel alpha blending.
      
      flags is used to specify whether alpha blending should be used
      (SDL::SRCALPHA) and whether the surface should use RLE acceleration
      for blitting (SDL::RLEACCEL). flags can be an OR'd combination of these
      two options, one of these options or 0. If SDL_SRCALPHA is not passed
      as a flag then all alpha information is ignored when blitting
      the surface. The alpha parameter is the per-surface alpha value,
      a surface need not have an alpha channel to use
      per-surface alpha and blitting can still be accelerated with
      SDL_RLEACCEL. Setting the per-surface alpha value to 0 disables
      per-surface alpha blending.

--- SDL::Surface#h
      Return height.

--- SDL::Surface#w
      Return width.

--- SDL::Surface#format
      Return pixel format.
      See ((<SDL::PixelFormat>)).

--- SDL::Surface#put(image,x,y)
      Draw image on (x,y) in self.
      This method are implemented using blitSurface.

--- SDL::Surface#copyRect(x,y,w,h)
--- SDL::Surface#copy_rect(x,y,w,h)
      Copy given rect and return copyed surface.
      
--- SDL::Surface#lock
      This method sets up a surface for directly accessing the pixels.You call
      this before calling ((<SDL::Surface#getPixel>)) ,
      ((<SDL::Surface#drawLine>)) or some other mehtods of Surface.

      Between calls to ((<SDL::Surface#lock>)) and ((<SDL::Surface#unlock>)),
      you can use methods that 'need locking'.
      Once you are done accessing the surface, you
      should use ((<SDL::Surface#unlock>)) to release it.
      
      Not all surfaces require locking. If ((<SDL::Surface#mustLock?>)) returns
      false, then you can read and write to the surface at any time, and the
      pixel format of the surface will not change.
      
      No operating system or library calls should be made between lock/unlock
      pairs, as critical system locks may be held during this time.
      
      If ((<SDL.autoLock>)) returns true,you don't have to call this methods
      because this library locks surface automatically.

--- SDL::Surface#unlock
      Unlock the surface.

--- SDL::Surface#mustLock?
--- SDL::Surface#must_lock?
      Returns true if you must lock surface for directly accessing the pixels,
      otherwise returns false.

      Draws an alpha bezier curve from (x1,y1) to (x4,y4) with the control
      points (x2,y2) and (x3,y3). level indicates how good precision
      the function should use, 4-7 is normal.
      
--- SDL::Surface#drawAABezierAlpha(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4,level,color,alpha)
--- SDL::Surface#draw_aa_bezier_alpha(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4,level,color,alpha)
      Needs SGE ,Needs lock
      
      Draws an antialiased alpha bezier curve from (x1,y1) to (x4,y4)
       with the control
      points (x2,y2) and (x3,y3). level indicates how good precision
      the function should use, 4-7 is normal.

--- SDL::Surface#rotateScaledSurface(angle,scale,bgcolor)
--- SDL::Surface#rotate_scaled_surface(angle,scale,bgcolor)
      Needs SGE
      This function makes the instance of Surface with a rotated and scaled
      copy of "self". "angle" is the rotation angle in degrees.
      "scale" is the scaling value , 1.0 is the normal size.

      This method is obsolete. Please use ((<SDL::Surface#transformSurface>)).

--- SDL::Surface#rotateSurface(angle,bgcolor)
--- SDL::Surface#rotate_surface(angle,bgcolor)
      Same as above,but with scale=1.0 .

--- SDL::Surface#transformSurface(bgcolor,angle,xscale,yscale,flags)
--- SDL::Surface#transform_surface(bgcolor,angle,xscale,yscale,flags)
      Creates a rotated and scaled image of src. See ((<SDL.transform>))
      for more information.

      * bgcolor - What background color should the new surface have.
      
--- SDL::Surface#mapRGB(r,g,b)

--- SDL::Surface#setPalette(flag,colors,firstcolor)
--- SDL::Surface#set_palette(flag,colors,firstcolor)
      Sets a portion of the palette for the given 8-bit surface.

      Palettized (8-bit) screen surfaces with the SDL_HWPALETTE flag have two
      palettes, a logical palette that is used for mapping blits to/from
      the surface and a physical palette (that determines how the
      hardware will map the colors to the display).

      This method can modify either the logical or physical
      palette by specifing SDL::LOGPAL or SDL::PHYSPAL in the flags parameter.

      If you want to modify the palette from Xth to th, you will give
      following array as colors, and X as firstcolor.
        [ [rX,gX,bX],[rX+1,gX+1,bX+1], ... ,[rY,gY,bY] ]

--- SDL::Surface#setColors(colors,firstcolor)
--- SDL::Surface#set_colors(colors,firstcolor)
      Same as ((<SDL::Surface#setPalette>)), but flag is
      SDL::LOGPAL|SDL::PHYSPAL.

--- SDL::Surface#getPalette
--- SDL::Surface#get_palette
      Returns the palette of the specified surface. Return value is array
      as following.
        [ [r0,g0,b0],[r1,g1,b1], ... ,[r255,g255,b255] ]
      Returns nil if the surface have no palette.

--- SDL::Surface#makeCollisionMap
      Need SGE

      Create a collision map.  Call SetColorKey first.  Every
      non-transparent pixel in the surface is set to solid in the collision
      map.  Returns an instance of CollisionMap.

=== SDL::CollisionMap

Need SGE

This is a map of which pixels in a surface are solid and which are
transparent.  Its methods can quickly determine whether or not two
surfaces would overlap if drawn at particular coordinates.

Only ((<SDL::Surface#makeCollisionMap>)) makes this object.

==== class method

--- SDL::CollisionMap#boundingBoxCheck(x1, y1, w1, h1, x2, y2, w2, h2)
      Return true if the bounding boxes overlap.

==== method

--- SDL::CollisionMap#collisionCheck(x1, y1, collisionMap, x2, y2)
      Determine if this collision map, if drawn with its upper-left
      corner at (x1, y1), would collide with collisionMap if drawn
      with its upper-left corner at (x2, y2).  If so, return the
      coordinate of the last collision found as an array ([x, y]).
      If no collision, returns nil.

      This method calls boundingBoxCheck automatically.

--- SDL::CollisionMap#boundingBoxCheck(x1, y1, collisionMap, x2, y2)
      Return true if the bounding boxes of the two maps would overlap if
      drawn with upper-left corners at (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

--- SDL::CollisionMap#clear(x1, y1, w, h)
      Clear (make transparent) an area of the collision map.

--- SDL::CollisionMap#set(x1, y1, w, h)
      Set (make solid) an area of the collision map.

=== SDL::Screen

SDL display the image that the instance of "Screen" have.
Only ((<SDL.setVideoMode>)) makes this object.
In fact the class named "Screen" doesn't exist,and the object that
SDL::setVideoMode returns is the instance of Surface with following
singleton methods.

==== super class

((<SDL::Surface>))

==== class method


==== method

--- SDL::Screen#updateRect(x,y,w,h)
--- SDL::Screen#update_rect(x,y,w,h)
      Makes sure the given  rectangle is updated on the given screen.
      Thhis function should not be called while screen is locked.

      If 'x', 'y', 'w' and 'h' are all 0, SDL_UpdateRect will update the entire
      screen.

--- SDL::Screen#flip
      On hardware that supports double-buffering, this method sets up a flip
      and returns. The hardware will wait for vertical retrace, and then swap
      video buffers before the next video surface blit or lock will return. On
      hardware that doesn't support double-buffering, this is equivalent to
      calling ((<SDL::Screen#updateRect>))(0, 0, 0, 0)
      
      The SDL::DOUBLEBUF flag must have been passed to
      ((<SDL.setVideoMode>)), when
      setting the video mode for this method to perform hardware flipping.

=== SDL::PixelFormat

((<SDL::Surface>)) has all methods of ((<SDL::PixelFormat>)).
This class is obsolete,
and you should use ((<SDL::Surface>)) instead of ((<SDL::PixelFormat>)).

In SDL you can use some type surface,for example 32bit color surface and
16bit surface.Therefore you need the information about that type,and
object of PixelFormat represents this information.

In this lib,you use one integer to specify color.To change from r,g,b value
to this integer you use ((<SDL::PixelFormat#mapRGB>)) and to change this integer
to r,g,b value ((<SDL::PixelFormat#getRGB>))

==== super class

Object

==== class method

nothing

==== method

--- SDL::PixelFormat#mapRGB(r,g,b)
    Maps the RGB color value to the specified pixel format and returns the
    pixel value as a integer.

--- SDL::PixelFormat#mapRGBA(r,g,b,a)
      Same as above,but includes alpha value.

--- SDL::PixelFormat#getRGB(pixel)
      Get RGB component values from a pixel stored in the specified pixel
      format.Returns r,g,b value in array as [r,g,b].

--- SDL::PixelFormat#getRGBA(pixel)
      Same as above, but return value includes alplah value.
      Returns r,g,b,a in arrary as [r,g,b,a].

--- SDL::PixelFormat#bpp

--- SDL::PixelFormat#colorkey
      Not documented yet

--- SDL::PixelFormat#alpha
      Not documented yet

(2) Call ((<SDL.init>)) with SDL::INIT_VIDEO
(3) Set attribute of OpenGL, please use ((<SDL.setGLAttr>))
(4) Call ((<SDL.setVideoMode>)) with SDL::OPENGL
(5) Use GL module methods to draw
(6) Call ((<SDL.GLSwapBuffersn>)) instead of ((<SDL.flip>)) to update screen

Please see sample/opengl.rb .

=== Avoid pthread problem
You can possibly avoid Ruby/SDL pthread problem when you put following 
in your script.
  require 'rbconfig'
  
  if RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /linux/
    trap('INT','EXIT')
    trap('EXIT','EXIT')
  end
