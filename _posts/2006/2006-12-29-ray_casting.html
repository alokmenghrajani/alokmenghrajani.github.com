<p>I wrote a ray caster in Ruby for fun. Using SDL, this piece of code lets
you navigate a maze using your mouse.</p>
<p>Ray casting is the technique used by Wolfenstein 3D. It allows rendering
3D worlds with minimal computional work by assuming that all the walls are
perpendicular to the floor.</p>
