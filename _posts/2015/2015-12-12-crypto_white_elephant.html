<div class="lead">
  <p>Seven cryptographers would like to exchange presents with each other. They
  are geographically located in different places, so they can't use a
  traditional white elephant scheme (everyone brings a wrapped gift and puts it
  on a table, people then draw names and take turn picking a gift).
  </p>
  <p>Can you figure out a cryptographically equivalent scheme?</p>
</div>
<p>Specifically, design a distributed algorithm where:
  <ul>
    <li>The algorithm results in every cryptographer knowing who they need
    to get a present for (they can tailor their presents) but not knowing who is
    getting them a present (there's a surprise factor).</li>
    <li>Each cryptographer has a public/private key pair.</li>
    <li>Each cryptographer knows the public key of the other six participants,
    as well as their address (so they can mail the presents).</li>
  </ul>
</p>
