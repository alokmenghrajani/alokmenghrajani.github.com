<p>
  I am an engineer on the infosec team. If you are interested in any aspect
  of computer security (from hardware/low level stuff to backend infrastructure,
  writing secure web application or working on Android/iOS) you should
  really consider talking to our team!
</p>
<p>
  I love working at Square. We are helping people grow their businesses.
  More important for me, I find my peers to be very altruistic: you can walk up to any engineer and ask them questions or schedule a pair-programming session with them,
  bounce ideas off each other, etc. I have never seen this kind of healthy
  engineering culture at any other tech company, we have something special going on.
</p>
<p>
  Square has a strong open source culture and the infosec team has contributed
  several projects over the years. For example:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/square/keywhiz">keywhiz</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/square/go-jose">go-jose</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/square/js-jose">js-jose</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/square/ghostunnel">ghostunnel</a></li>
  </ul>
