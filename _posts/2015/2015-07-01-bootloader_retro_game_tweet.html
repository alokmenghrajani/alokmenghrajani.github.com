    <p>
      In 1998, people were competing to write the smallest possible DOS
      games, a type of progamming competition later coined as
      "code golfing".
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to revisit one such piece of code (nibbles.asm) but turn
      it into a bootable floppy image which can fit in a tweet (140 characters):
    </p>
    <pre style="code">perl -E"say'sgFoAKAHvqB9uBMAzRC/wPi5gAjzqqqBxz4Bc/jkYDxIchE8UHcNN5hISH
IFLAJrwLCJwgHWtQa0C80Q4vwmMCR72uv','B'x589,'Vao='"|base64 -D>boot.img</pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    * Technically, my code isn't a bootloader. A real bootloader does things
    like setup the x86 machine in protected mode, load more data from the
    disk (the BIOS only loads the first 512 bytes), etc. I skip all of that
    and instead setup some registers and jump straight into the game.

  <h3>hugi.de</h3>
  <p>
    A popular website which hosted such competitions was Hugi and one of my
    favorite entries was "Nibbles by Altair/ODDS entertainment",
    an implementation of nibbles (also known as Tron or Snakes) in only
    48 bytes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, running the original code today isn't very easy: you need
    DOS and if you are running in an emulator, the assumptions the original
    programmers made about their hardware (and often the speed of their
    hardware) needs to hold up.
  </p>
  <p>
    I therefore decided to take Altair's code and turn it into a bootable
    floppy disk. I also made a few tweaks to make the game more playable.

    The code in the tweet creates a bootable file <code>boot.img</code>. You
    can boot the code in qemu, virtual box or your favorite virtualization
    software and play the game with the arrow keys.
