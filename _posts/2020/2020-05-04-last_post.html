<p>I started this blog around 1996, hosting it on geocities.com at first. What
started as a small collection of random posts about chess and computers graphics
grew into a collection of around 100 posts covering a wide array of
computer science topics: from quines to size optimization. From web security to
compilers/language design. And many other topics.</p>

<p>The last few years, I tried to write one post a month, a pace I enjoyed.</p>

<p>Today, after hosting this site for over 20 years and serving several million
page views, I have decided to make this my last post. Having a family and a
child, I no longer have the time or inclination to write a post every month. It
also feels nice to wrap things up; going from a constant "work in progress" to a
"finished" state.</p>

<p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Panos and M. Pierre,
two people who enlighted me with their computer knowledge and gave me the
enthusiasm to become a software engineer as well as all the bright fellow
engineers I worked with and continue working with.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my blog, I hope you enjoy the content.</p>

<p>Feel free to create a local copy of all the posts with:<br/>
<code>git clone https://github.com/alokmenghrajani/alokmenghrajani.github.com.git</code> and then run <code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code>.</p>
