<p><a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> is a free and open source software for 3D modeling. Supported platforms
include Windows, Mac, and Linux. In order to learn
some basics of Blender, I revisited <a href="/3d_printed_chess_set/">an old project</a> of mine from a few years ago which
involves designing and 3D printing a chess set.</p>

<p>One way to learn Blender is to watch Youtube tutorials. For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elUJCEC06r8">Blender 2.8 Beginner 3D Modeling Tutorial</a>
explains basic Blender user interface elements as well as basic modeling techniques. Those basic techniques are enough
for modeling a king, bishop, and pawn. <a href="https://b3d.interplanety.org/en/modeling-with-curves-wires-and-pipes/">Modeling with curves: wires and pipes</a>
gave me the knowledge to model the knight by explaining how to use Bezier curve. Finally, the rook and queen required
creating cuts in the model, a skill I learned by reading
<a href="https://www.katsbits.com/tutorials/blender/character-2-mesh-editing-making.php">Objects & Mesh Editing A Simple Character In Blender</a>.</p>

<p>I decided to make my pieces roughly the same height as a standard Staunton set. My pieces are
<a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a>-ish, so I aimed for equal base surface area. Chess sets typically come with
weights, so I poked some holes (using boolean modifiers). I used the following table, based on my personal measurement,
as a guide:
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>piece</th><th>weight</th><th>dimensions</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody><tr><td>pawn</td><td>14g</td><td>⌀ 27mm x 46mm</td></tr>
  <tr><td>rook</td><td>35g</td><td>⌀ 32mm x 47mm</td></tr>
  <tr><td>knight</td><td>35g</td><td>⌀ 32mm x 58mm</td></tr>
  <tr><td>bishop</td><td>27g</td><td>⌀ 32mm x 63mm</td></tr>
  <tr><td>queen</td><td>46g</td><td>⌀ 36mm x 76mm</td></tr>
  <tr><td>king</td><td>55g</td><td>⌀ 37mm x 96mm</td></tr>
  </tbody></table>
</p>

<p>I initially didn't think about rendering a final image in Blender (since my end goal is 3D printing the pieces). I
figured I'd still give it a shot and I'm quite happy with my textures but I definitely haven't mastered the
lighting aspect of things. The board I modeled is inspired by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knpes6fKhpQ">Making an end grain chessboard</a>, a video showcasing beautful
craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Since I don't own a 3D printer, I explored various printing services: shapeways.com, i.materialise.com, 3dhubs.com,
xometry.com, craftcloud3d.com, and sculpteo.com. The prices varied by over a factor 5x, so make sure to shop around
if you ever need a 3D printing service! Obviously the material you pick plays a significant role, with PLA being among
the cheapest and resin/metals being much more expensive. If you are 3D printing at home, make sure to properly vent
the room where you print — you don't want to be breading any toxic fumes!</p>

<p>Chess pieces typically use lead (Pb) or ferrite to add weight to them. I decided to explore tungsten (W) since lead
is toxic. Tungsten is also among the densest materials available, resulting in nicely weighted pieces. For reference,
tungsten's density is 19 g/cm³ while lead is about 11 g/cm³, bismuth 10 g/cm³, stainless steel 8 g/cm³, and common
magnets are typically 5-8 g/cm³ depending if ferrite, neodymium, or samarium-cobalt is used.</p>

<p>Tungsten is however difficult to work with; I don't have the necessary tools to cut, sand, or shape it. I decided
to use Alibaba to contact tungsten suppliers in China. I asked for quotes for 5mm rods cut to 20mm and 30mm lengths.
I received various quotes, ranging from $85 to $200. I picked the cheapest supplier since the material won't be
visible.</p>

<p>Total time+money: ~1 week to learn Blender, ~2 days to model the pieces, ~1 day to compare
prices across 3D printing services, ~1 day to contact tungsten suppliers, $85.46 for printing pieces, $88.95 for weights
(yes I paid more for the weights than the pieces!). $0 for glue and felt I already had lying around. Overall, the chess
set turned out fairly expensive (I could have purchased a giant lawn set for the same price) but it's the price to pay
for custom manufacturing ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</p>

<p>I achieved my goal of learning some basic Blender skills and being able to
manufacter something without leaving my home feels magical!</p>

<p>(note: if you are doing a similar project and are thin on the money side, you might want to consider 3D printing
molds and then making pieces out of resin or even concrete!)</p>
