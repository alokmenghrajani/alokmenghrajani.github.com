<p><a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> is a free and open source software for 3D modeling. Supported
platforms include Windows, Mac, and Linux. I revisited <a href="/3d_printed_chess_set/">an old project</a> of mine
from a few years ago with the purpose of learning some basics of Blender. This article explains the design and
3D printing of a custom chess set.</p>

<p>An efficient way to learn Blender is to watch various Youtube tutorials. Most are short and focus on a specific
skill. For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elUJCEC06r8">Blender 2.8 Beginner 3D Modeling Tutorial</a>
explains the user interface as well as basic modeling techniques, which enabled me to model the king, bishop, and pawn.
<a href="https://b3d.interplanety.org/en/modeling-with-curves-wires-and-pipes/">Modeling with curves: wires and pipes</a>
gave me the knowledge to model the knight by leveraging Bezier curves. Finally, the rook and queen required
creating cuts in the model, a skill explained in
<a href="https://www.katsbits.com/tutorials/blender/character-2-mesh-editing-making.php">Objects & Mesh Editing A Simple Character In Blender</a>.</p>

<p>My pieces are roughly the same height as a standard Staunton set. Each piece is
<a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a>-ish and has an equal base surface area as its standard counter part. Chess
sets typically come with
weights. Holes to house weights were therefore poked using boolean modifiers. If you are interested to design your
own chess set, the following table lists approximate measurments:
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>piece</th><th>dimensions</th><th>weight</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody><tr><td>pawn</td><td>⌀ 27mm x 46mm</td><td>14g</td></tr>
  <tr><td>rook</td><td>⌀ 32mm x 47mm</td><td>35g</td></tr>
  <tr><td>knight</td><td>⌀ 32mm x 58mm</td><td>35g</td></tr>
  <tr><td>bishop</td><td>⌀ 32mm x 63mm</td><td>27g</td></tr>
  <tr><td>queen</td><td>⌀ 36mm x 76mm</td><td>46g</td></tr>
  <tr><td>king</td><td>⌀ 37mm x 96mm</td><td>55g</td></tr>
  </tbody></table>
</p>

<p>While rendering a final image in Blender wasn't a priority, the following image shows the result of placing the
pieces on a board with custom textures and some basic lighting. The lighting, far from ideal, is the hardest part to
master. The board is inspired by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knpes6fKhpQ">Making an end grain chessboard</a>, a video showcasing beautiful
craftsmanship.</p>

<p>I don't own a 3D printer, so various printing services were compared for price: <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a>,
<a href="https://i.materialise.com/en">i.materialise</a>, <a href="https://www.3dhubs.com/">3D Hubs</a>,
<a href="https://www.xometry.com/">Xometry</a>, <a href="https://craftcloud3d.com/">Craftcloud</a>, and
<a href="https://www.sculpteo.com/en/">Sculpteo</a>. The prices varied by over a factor 5x, so make sure to shop around
if you ever need a 3D printing service! The material you pick plays a significant role, with PLA being one the cheapest
and resin/metals being more expensive. If you are 3D printing at home, make sure to properly vent
the room where you print — you don't want to be breathing any toxic fumes!</p>

<p>Chess pieces typically use lead (Pb) or ferrite to add weight to them. I decided to explore tungsten (W) since lead
is toxic. Tungsten is also among the densest materials available, resulting in nicely weighted pieces. For reference,
tungsten's density is 19 g/cm³ while lead is about 11 g/cm³, bismuth 10 g/cm³, stainless steel 8 g/cm³, and common
magnets are typically 5-8 g/cm³ depending if ferrite, neodymium, or samarium-cobalt is used.</p>

<p>Tungsten is however difficult to work with; I don't have the necessary tools to cut, sand, or shape it. I decided
to use Alibaba to contact tungsten suppliers in China and have the material cut to exact specifications. The quotes
for 5mm rods cut to 20mm and 30mm lengths ranged from $89 to $200 for 1.5 kg of pure tungsten. The cheapest supplier was
chosen since the weights aren't visible.</p>

<p>Total time+money: ~1 week to learn Blender, ~2 days to model the pieces, ~1 day to compare
prices across 3D printing services, ~1 day to contact tungsten suppliers, $85 for printing pieces, $89 for weights
(yes the weights cost more than the pieces!). Overall, the chess set turned out fairly expensive (a giant lawn set could
have been purchased for the same price) but it's the price to pay for custom manufacturing ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Picture
of the finished project:</p>

<p>The goal of learning basic Blender and 3D modeling skills was achieved. Being able to
manufacter something without leaving your home feels magical!</p>

<p>(note: if you are doing a similar project and are thin on the money side, you might want to consider 3D printing
molds and then making pieces out of resin or even concrete!)</p>
