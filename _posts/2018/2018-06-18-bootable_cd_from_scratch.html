<p>A few years ago, I crafted a <a href="/bootloader_retro_game_tweet/">bootable floppy disk and a retro game</a> which fit
in a tweet. Since then, Twitter doubled the length of tweets, so I decided to
handcraft a bootable CD. The bootable disk runs a slightly improved version of
tron.</p>

<pre>
perl -E 'say"A"x46422,"BDRDAwMQFFTCBUT1JJVE8gU1BFQ0lGSUNBVElPTg","A"x54,"Ew","A"x2634,"/0NEMDAxAQ","A"x2721,"BAAAAYQ","A"x30,"SVVVqogAAAAAAAEAF","A"x2676,"LMBaACgB76gfbgTAM0Qv8D4uYAI86qqgcc+AXP45GA8SHIRPFB3DTeYSEhyBSwCa8CwicMB3rSGtu/NFbRFJjAke9rrwQ","A"x2638'|base64 -D>cd.iso
</pre>
<div style="width: 75%; margin: 1rem auto">
  <p><small>
  The code in the tweet creates a bootable CDROM disk image: <code>cd.iso</code>. You
  can boot the code in qemu, virtual box or your favorite virtualization
  software and play the game with the arrow keys. You can even burn the iso to
  a blank CD (or USB drive) and boot real hardware.
</small></p>
  <p><small>note: on some systems, e.g. Linux, you'll have to use <code>base64 -d</code>.</small></p>
</div>

<p>To handcraft a CD disk image, you must first get a basic understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660">ISO 9660</a>. ISO standards unfortunately are usually expensive. ISO 9660 is however the same as <a href="/files/2018/bootable_cd_retro_game_tweet/ecma-119.pdf">ECMA 119</a>, which means you can read the specification for free.</p>

<p>ISO 9660 has many extensions, such as UDF, El Torito, RockRidge, Joliet, etc. For bootable images, we only
care about <a href="/files/2018/bootable_cd_retro_game_tweet/el_torito.pdf">El Torito</a>. The El Torito specification is, in my opinion, poorly written. There are mistakes (e.g. figure 7, last row), it's easy to forget that values are hex (no <code>0x</code> prefixes), the figures aren't sorted in an intuitive order, etc. Thankfully, the document is fairly
short.</p>

<p>To create a bootable disk, we start by writing 17 empty sectors followed by the Volume Descriptor Set. A sector is 2048 bytes.</p>
<p>Note: The ISO-9660 specification says the Volume Descriptor Set starts at sector 16. The El Torito specification calls for the Boot Record to live at sector 17. Technically, we should put a dummy Volume Descriptor in sector 16, but things seem to work fine without.</p>

<p>We write the first Volume Descriptor:</p>
<pre>
0x00                      // Type (0 = boot record)
'CD001'                   // Identifier
0x01                      // Version
'EL TORITO SPECIFICATION' // Boot System Identifier
9 x 0x00                  // Padding
32 x 0x00                 // Unused
0x13 0x00 0x00 0x00       // Boot Catalog address (in absolute sectors)
1973 x 0x00               // Unused
</pre>

<p>The next sector is the Volume Descriptor Set Terminator:</p>
<pre>
0xff                      // Type (255 = terminator)
'CD001'                   // Identifier
0x01                      // Version
2041 x 0x00               // Unused
</pre>

<p>The Volume Descriptors are followed by the Boot Catalog. El Torito supports various emulation modes. The CD-ROM
can emulate a bootable floppy, bootable harddrive, etc. I picked no emulation, which implies the BIOS will
load a specific number of sectors and jump into our bootloader.</p>
<p>The checksum is computed such that all 16-bit values in the record sum to 0 (mod 65536).</p>

<p>First entry in the Boot Catalog (Validation Entry):</p>
<pre>
0x01                      // Header ID
0x00                      // Platform ID (0 = Intel x86)
0x00 0x00                 // Reserved
'a'                       // ID string
23 x 0x00                 // Padding
cksum cksum               // Checksum (2 bytes)
0x55 0xaa                 // Key bytes
</pre>

<p>Second entry (Default Entry):</p>
<pre>
0x88                      // Boot Indicator (0x88 = bootable)
0x00                      // Boot Media Type (0 = no emulation)
0x00 0x00                 // Load segment
0x00                      // System Type
0x00                      // Unused
0x01 0x00                 // Number of sectors to load
0x14 0x00 0x00 0x00       // Virtual disk address (in absolute sectors)
20 x 0x00                 // Unused
</pre>

<p>Followed by zeros until the end of the sector:</p>
<pre>
1984 x 0x00               // Unused
</pre>

<p>The next sector is the bootloader / retro game:</p>

TIMES 2048 - ($ - $$) db 0             ; Fill the rest of the sector with 0
</pre>

<p>I then wrote a script to compile the bootloader, assemble the image, and
generate the tweet. Finally, I burned a CD and tested that things work on real
hardware.</p>
