<p>There are many ways to build prototype circuits or small one off projects.
In the past, I would sometimes see pictures of interesting approaches. However,
without knowing the name of the circuit style, it was hard to further my
knowledge about each technique. Hopefully, this page provides some useful
information if you are in a similar situation.</p>

<h1>Breadboard</h1>
<img src="/files/2022/circuit_boards/breadboard_inside_altoids_box.jpg">
<p>Breadboards are probably the easiest way to build temporary prototypes. I
  recommend buying lots of male/male jumper wires in different lengths and
  colors. Solid core wires are useful if you want tidy and easier to understand
  boards.</p>

<h1>Perfboard</h1>

<p>Perfboards might visually look like thin breadboards but each component is
  soldered. The result is a permanent prototype. Perfboards come in different
  styles (grid vs pads). You can also purchase perfboards with a matching
  enclosure.</p>

<h1>Stripboard</h1>

<p>Also known as Veroboard, stripboards are related to perfboards but have long
lines of interconnected pins. You typically cut breaks in the copper strips.</p>

<h1>Manhattan style</h1>

<p>An older technique, popular in radio-related circuits. Components are
  directly soldered on a copper base.</p>

<h1>Muppet style</h1>

<p>Similar to Manhattan but a PCB without any holes is first etched. Components
are then soldered on the PCB.</p>

<h1>Freeform</h1>

<p>These circuits have no base and are often very artistic. People have found
  ingenious ways to incorporate batteries in their freeform circuits.</p>

<h1>Printed Circuit Board (PCB)</h1>
<img src="/files/2022/circuit_boards/pcb.jpg">
<p>More involved, PCBs are the way to go if you want to easily create more than
  one copy of your circuit. It's also your main option once you start using
  surface mounted devices (SMD). Several companies enable low cost small batch
  manufacturing (e.g. print 3 identical small PCBs for $5). The
  turnaround time can however be a couple days. DIY PCB etching is a
  possibility but requires handling potentially hazardous chemicals. Most PCBs
  are just functional but there's plenty of room for
  <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/01/28/beautiful-and-bizarre-boards/">artistic expression</a>.</p>

<h1>Other</h1>
<p>You might come across esoteric circuits (such as <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2011/01/05/wood-pcbs-with-copper-paint-traces/">wood PCBs with copper traces</a>)
  or using <a href="/binary_adder/">Balsa</a>. There are also
  circuits on <a href="https://www.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/circuit-scribe-draw-circuits-instantly-with-conductive-ink-pen.gif">paper using conductive ink</a>. So many possibilities!</p>
