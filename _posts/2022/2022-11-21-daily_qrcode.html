<p>Today, I launched <a href="https://da.ilyqrco.de/">https://da.ilyqrco.de/</a>, a
  website which shows a different QR Code every day. Scan the QRCode with your
  phone's camera app to visit a daily website I consider interesting.</p>
<p>I pick the best content by browsing a select few subreddits, Hackernews,
  and various other sources. My goal is to surprise you with an interesting mix
  of technology, science, and fun content.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
