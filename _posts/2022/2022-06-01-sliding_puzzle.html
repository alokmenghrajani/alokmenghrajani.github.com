<p>I built a <a href="/sliding_puzzle/puzzle.html">Sliding Puzzle</a> web game.
  It was a lot of fun to come up with three different difficuly levels and
  write the
  <a href="https://github.com/alokmenghrajani/sliding_puzzle">code</a>.
  The puzzle has a Rubik's cube-like feel to it, which makes the hard level
  particularly hard!</p>
<p>The game supports mouse, touch, and keyboard. Gettings things to work
  across different devices and types of browsers was a bit challenging --
  especially figuring out ways to avoid touch gesture conflicts.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
