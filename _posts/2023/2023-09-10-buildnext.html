<p><a href="/buildnext">Buildnext</a> is a free web tool that takes your LEGO inventory
  (list of sets by their identification number) and calculates the list of LEGO sets you can
  build with a link to <a href="https://rebrickable.com/">rebrickable.com</a>.
  Most sets have downloadable instructions either directly on <a href="https://rebrickable.com/">rebrickable.com</a>
  or on one of the other popular sites (such as <a href="https://bricklink.com/">bricklink.com</a>, <a href="https://brickset.com/">brickset.com</a>, or
  <a href="https://brickowl.com/">brickowl.com</a>).</p>
<p>Hopefully, this tool will give you even more hours of fun with your LEGO and kids.</p>
