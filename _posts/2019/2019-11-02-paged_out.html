<p>I published two articles in <a href="/files/2019/pagedout/PagedOut_002_beta2.pdf">PagedOut! Issue #2</a>.
PagedOut! is a new spin on the traditional "hacker" ezines. Every issue is filled with very interesting
technical topics (covering programming, code golfing, quines, hacking, infosec, retro computers, modern computers,
electronics, demoscene, and more). Each issue also features an amazing cover-page artwork. Articles are one page long.</p>

<p>My first article (page 19), <a href="https://quaxio.com/an_artisanal_qr_code.html">An artisanal QR code</a>, explains how to craft a QR code from scratch.</p>

<p>My second article (page 41), ðŸŽƒðŸ‘»ðŸ•· <a href="/spooky_fizz_buzz">Spooky Fizz Buzz</a>, is a unique implementation of Fizz Buzz, which uses
  the font engine to render "3" as "fizz", 5 as "buzz", etc.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy reading both of those articles, as well as all the other amazing content.</p>
