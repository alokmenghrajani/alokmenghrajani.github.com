<p>I published two articles in <a href="/files/2019/pagedout/PagedOut_002_beta2.pdf">PagedOut! Issue #2</a>.
PagedOut! is a new spin on the traditional "hacker" ezines. Every issue is filled with very interesting
technical topics and an amazing cover-page artwork. Each article is a page long.</p>

<p>The first article (page 19), An artisanal QR code, explains how to craft a QR code from scratch.</p>

<p>The second article (page 41), ðŸŽƒðŸ‘»ðŸ•· Spooky Fizz Buzz, is a unique implementation of Fizz Buzz, which uses
  the font engine to render "3" as "fizz", 5 as "buzz", etc.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy reading both of those articles, as well as all the other amazing content.</p>
