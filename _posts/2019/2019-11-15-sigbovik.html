<p><a href="http://sigbovik.org/">Sigbovik</a> is a prestigious computer-science conference held at CMU on April 1st of every year.
  The content is joke topics, but the actual research is sometimes pretty serious.</p>

<p>Some of the my favorite publications include Tom7's work (<a href="http://tom7.org/mario/">software that learns to play Nintendo games</a> and <a href="http://tom7.org/chess/cve.pdf">#KingMe attack</a>).
  Proceedings for every year are freely available for <a href="http://sigbovik.org/">download</a>.</p>

<p>Fun fact: I made a list of joke ideas to try and publish something. Many of my ideas turned out to be topics
  people are actively investing real energy (and money) in. Go figure...</p>
