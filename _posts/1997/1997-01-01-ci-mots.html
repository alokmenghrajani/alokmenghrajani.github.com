<p>A few days ago, I learned to write Mac OS 7 software. I then made a game
which is being published in Univers Mac. The game is called "Ci-mots". It is
similar to Mastermind but uses a word code instead of colors. A popular french
TV game show has the same mechanics but with 7-letter words. See the screen
recording below or play the game with an emulator!</p>
