    Every year (since last year) Eric Wastl organizes a programming contest. The contest runs
    from December 1st to December 25th and each day a puzzle is revealed at midnight UTC.

    Some people compete for speed. I decided to use this as an opportunity to learn a new
    programming language and picked <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>.

    Rust is a system's language which is designed with interesting safety properties. The memory model doesn't
    use a garbage collector or reference counting scheme, but instead leverages a borrow system which reminds me
    of <a href="https://github.com/pikatchu/LinearML/blob/b1a49f153e02f3cffb32784f2eeb7fca017b2791/README">LinearML</a>.

    In theory, such a system is more efficient as the number of cores on our processor grows. Let's see how this plays
    out in the long term?

    You can see how I'm doing or learn from my solutions by checking out <a href="https://github.com/alokmenghrajani/adventofcode/">my Rust repo</a>.
