  <p>
    A puzzle I designed for Square's 2016 CTF. I was inspired by
    <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-badge.html">DefCon's
    badge</a> puzzles (significantly easier to solve however).

    Want to try it out? Reach out to me and I might be able to mail out a spare.

  <h3>Some info</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Feel free to abuse the hardware; it's yours.</li>
    <li>The board is easy to power from a wide range of sources. Don't go over ~35V. Some
      components might heat up a little.</li>
    <li>Solving the puzzle may require using sharp or hot tools (knives, soldering iron, etc.). Handle
      your tools carefully.</li>

  <h3>Hazardous substances</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The board is lead-free. It was printed thru <a href="https://oshpark.com/">Oshpark</a>.</li>
    <li>The components were choosen to be RoHS compliant, lead free. They were
      purchased on <a href="https://www.digikey.com">Digikey</a></li>
    <li>I used a variety of different solder. Unfortunately, most solder contains
      lead. Keep out of the reach of children.</li>
  </ul>
