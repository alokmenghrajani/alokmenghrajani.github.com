[Keepass](http://keepass.info/) is a nice little tool that will securely store all your passwords. I have been using this tool for about 6 months, and I like the following features:
- It is open source.
- It is very easy to install and use (whether you are using Windows or one of the large Linux distributions).
- It can perform auto-type (the software simulates the keyboard and sends: the username, &lt;tab&gt;, the password, &lt;enter&gt;).
- You can use the tool to generate strong passwords.
- You can copy the database file to your phone and use the Java version to access your passwords in case of emergency (I usually don't access my accounts from other people's computers).
