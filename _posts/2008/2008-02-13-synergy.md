A lot of people work with their laptop and desktop at the same time. If you are in the same situation, <a href="http://synergy-foss.org/" class="external">Synergy</a> is a very useful tool. It lets you share a single mouse and keyboard between multiple computers. To switch from one computer to the other, you simply move the mouse outside one screen onto the next one.

Synergy is free, open source and supported on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
