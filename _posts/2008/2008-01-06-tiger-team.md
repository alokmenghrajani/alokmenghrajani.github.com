TigerTeam is a new show about physical security. In the first episode, the team steals a fancy car from a dealership. In the second episode they steal some jewelery. I like the way they bypass motion detectors, copy RFIDs, etc.

TruTV said they won't continue the show. I wonder if people were upset about the content of the show (exposing security weaknesses) or if the show was doomed to get pretty boring after the first few episodes (I personally loved the first episode. The second episode was already a little repetitive).
