<p>HSM (Hardware Security Modules) are pieces of hardware used to protect
sensitive cryptographic keys and perform cryptographic operations. These devices
are typically used in the banking and defense industry. Developers can use
existing APIs or extend the devices capabilities. In the case of nCipher
devices, the framework for implementing extensions is called CodeSafe
and the code is typically written in C (e.g. see <a href="https://github.com/square/subzero">Subzero</a>, Square's HSM-based Bitcoin Cold Storage wallet).</p>

<p>One of my last hacks while working at Square was to build a prototype showing
how CodeSafe code could be written using Rust. The main appeal for using Rust is
memory safety/better guarantees compared to C. Rust also enables leveraging a
rich ecosystem of packages and libraries.</p>
