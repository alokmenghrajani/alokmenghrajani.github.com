<p>Writing a unix shell is a great way to familiarize with the concepts of
process control and signaling.</p>
<p>As part of 15213 (introduction to computer systems), I implemented a shell
with the following features:
<ul>
<li>quit, fg, bg and jobs built-in commands.</li>
<li>use of &amp; (foreground / background jobs).</li>
<li>catch SIGCHILD, SIGINT and SIGSTOP signals.</li>
